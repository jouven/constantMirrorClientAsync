//client/"destination": the program has a configuration of several remote file/directory paths mapped to local file/directory paths
//the program can request a list (hash+size) of remote file/directories paths per mapping to a serer/"source" program,
//this list it's tailored on the server/"source" program and client/"destination" will always recieve the same no matter the client side paths configurations,
//except if the server configuration is changed but that doesn't depende on the client
//client/"destination" also has a tcp server to recieve requests telling if anything has changed from the server/"source" program
//so it can request the list again to check for changes.

//right now it's command-line-always-running-process
